# 20201021 - render and display image (bitmap)

I am working on a handwriting application. The application draws the user's "input" directly on the "window". GDI was used as rendering API. However, I also want to get the image (bitmap) representation of the "canvas/window" in order to do some image processing. I think I might need to use a separate API for drawing on a two-dimemsional array and render that array on the "window". I think I will learn about [bitmaps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdi/bitmaps) in the next few days.
